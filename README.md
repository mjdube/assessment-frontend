# Bi-me Front-End Assessment test

## Overview & Instructions

Hello and welcome, Included on this folder are three files README.md file(for instructions), Figma file (for the look and feel) and a questions.json file for the data you will have to use for the challenge:

* Create a simple react application with a react CLI tool of your choosing.
* Use this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sFtOZVVt7lP2XfeWx9lLoH/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) file to create your form fields components (to showcase your attention to detail)
* Using [Formik](https://formik.org/) create Formik fields using the provided questions.json and display them on the application (please note: do not copy paste the data on the questions.json, simply import the json as it is and render your fields dynamically using formik). 
* On the questions.json you'll find that some of the questions have conditions. use those conditions to display the question fields as required.
* If the question has no conditions, display the question by default. i.e. Q2 will only display if the value of Q1 is true

## Tools and Technologies to use

* [Formik](https://formik.org/)
* [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com//)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sFtOZVVt7lP2XfeWx9lLoH/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)


## Submission instructions 
* Everything should be done on Github and shared with Tanaka Malaba at the completion of the challenge.

## All the best and hope to see you on the team.
